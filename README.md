# NAWCD
Advanced Web Change Detection + Price change and stock monitor. Drop in website link and get going with ease and breeze!

# Why use this?
There's https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io yes, but I can't guarantee you, you will have much fun and ease in using it, nor that it will capture prices properly, thus I decided to develop this.  
Goal is to be feature complete in funcitonallity just like changedetection.io, and if possible even beyond ;)
